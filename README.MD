In this prooject I defined the following architecture to execute it.
![Architecture Defined](./pics/architecture.png)

## Context
A company in the e-commerce sector operates across various regions in Brazil, selling a variety of technology products, such as computers, smartphones, and peripherals. The company serves both corporate clients and individual consumers. The company is interested in monitoring and analyzing its sales to understand customer behavior, product performance, and regional trends over time.

### Objective:
The company aims to build a data analytics system that allows detailed collection and analysis of sales. This includes the ability to segment data by customer, location, product, and time period. The system should assist in strategic decision-making, such as launching new promotions, adjusting inventory, and expanding into new regions.

### Details of the Companyâ€™s Operations:
The company sells technology products to its customers, who may be either individual consumers or businesses. Each sale is associated with a specific customer and takes place in a specific geographic location. The system needs to record the product sold, the quantity, the sale price, and the cost of the product.
