The **logical model** for a Data Warehouse (DW) bridges the gap between the **conceptual model** and the **physical model** by detailing the structure of the tables, relationships, and data types at a more abstract level, without specific implementation details such as storage or performance optimizations. It captures the **entity relationships**, **keys**, and **attribute types** necessary for designing the physical model.

Based on the provided **conceptual model** and **physical model** for the e-commerce company's DW, here's how the logical model would look:

---

### **Logical Model**

#### 1. **Fact Table: Sales Fact (fact_sales)**

The **fact table** stores the key metrics for sales transactions. This table contains foreign keys that link to the dimension tables and several measures for analysis (e.g., quantity sold, sale price, product cost, total revenue).

**Attributes:**
- **Sale_ID** (Primary Key) – Unique identifier for each sale.
- **Quantity** – Number of products sold.
- **Sale_Price** – Price at which each product was sold.
- **Product_Cost** – Cost of the product for the company.
- **Total_Sale_Value** – Derived metric: `Quantity * Sale_Price`.
- **Foreign Keys:**
  - **Customer_ID** – Links to the Customer Dimension.
  - **Product_ID** – Links to the Product Dimension.
  - **Location_ID** – Links to the Location Dimension.
  - **Time_ID** – Links to the Time Dimension.
- **Sales Revenue** – Total revenue generated by the sale.

#### 2. **Dimension Table: Customer Dimension (dim_customer)**

The **Customer Dimension** provides information on the customers, enabling segmentation and analysis based on customer types and statuses.

**Attributes:**
- **Customer_ID** (Primary Key) – Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Customer_Name** – Name of the customer.
- **Customer_Type** – Type of the customer (e.g., Corporate, Consumer).
- **Customer_Status** – Status of the customer (e.g., Active, Inactive).

#### 3. **Dimension Table: Product Dimension (dim_product)**

The **Product Dimension** stores detailed information about the products, enabling analysis based on product categories, subcategories, and brands.

**Attributes:**
- **Product_ID** (Primary Key) – Unique identifier for each product.
- **Product_Name** – Name of the product.
- **Product_Category** – Category of the product (e.g., Electronics, Furniture).
- **Product_Subcategory** – Subcategory of the product (e.g., Laptops, Desktops).
- **Product_Brand** – Brand of the product (e.g., Apple, Samsung).

#### 4. **Dimension Table: Location Dimension (dim_location)**

The **Location Dimension** allows geographic analysis, enabling the company to analyze sales by city, state, and region.

**Attributes:**
- **Location_ID** (Primary Key) – Unique identifier for each location.
- **City** – City where the sale occurred.
- **State** – State where the sale occurred.
- **Region** – Geographic region (e.g., North, South, etc.).

#### 5. **Dimension Table: Time Dimension (dim_time)**

The **Time Dimension** is essential for time-based analysis, providing temporal information at various granularities (e.g., day, month, quarter).

**Attributes:**
- **Time_ID** (Primary Key) – Unique identifier for each date.
- **Date** – Specific date of the sale.
- **Month** – Month of the sale.
- **Year** – Year of the sale.
- **Quarter** – Quarter of the year (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th).
- **Seasonality** – Indicates if the date falls within specific seasons (e.g., Black Friday, Christmas).

### **Relationships in the Logical Model**

- **Fact Table Relationships:**
  - The **Sales Fact table** (`fact_sales`) contains **foreign keys** to the dimension tables. These foreign keys allow for joining the fact table with the dimensions, facilitating queries and analysis.
  - The fact table will be linked to:
    - **Customer Dimension** via `Customer_ID`
    - **Product Dimension** via `Product_ID`
    - **Location Dimension** via `Location_ID`
    - **Time Dimension** via `Time_ID`

- **Dimension Table Relationships:**
  - Each **dimension table** is independent and contains descriptive information relevant to the entities (customers, products, locations, and time).
  - The dimensions are not directly related to each other but are connected via the fact table, forming a **star schema** structure.

### **Key Features of the Logical Model**

1. **Star Schema Structure:** The model is a classic **star schema**, where the fact table (sales) is at the center and dimension tables (customer, product, location, time) provide descriptive context.
2. **Fact Table Metrics:** The fact table contains the core metrics (e.g., `Quantity`, `Sale_Price`, `Total_Sale_Value`) necessary for sales analysis.
3. **Dimension Tables:** Each dimension table provides details that enrich analysis, such as customer types, product categories, and geographic regions.
4. **Granularity:** The **grain** of the fact table is at the sales transaction level, meaning each row represents one sale.
