To build the conceptual model of the Data Warehouse (DW) for the described e-commerce company, we can use the **Dimensional Model**, composed of **fact tables** and **dimension tables**. The goal of the conceptual model is to provide a simplified view, highlighting the main entities, their relationships, and the essential attributes that should be captured.

### 1. **Fact Tables**
The fact table contains quantitative and transactional data. In the case of the e-commerce company, the main fact will be the sales transactions.

- **Sales Fact**: This table will capture the completed sales transactions. It will include the following information:
  - Primary key: **Sale_ID**
  - **Quantity_Sold**
  - **Sale_Price**
  - **Product_Cost**
  - **Total_Sale_Value** (calculated from the quantity and sale price)
  - **Customer_ID** (foreign key to the Customer dimension)
  - **Product_ID** (foreign key to the Product dimension)
  - **Location_ID** (foreign key to the Location dimension)
  - **Time_ID** (foreign key to the Time dimension)

### 2. **Dimension Tables**
Dimensions provide context to the facts and enable analysis from different perspectives.

- **Customer Dimension**: Captures information about customers, both individual and corporate.
  - Primary key: **Customer_ID**
  - **Customer_Name**
  - **Customer_Type** (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Inactive)
  - **Customer_Status** (Active or Inactive)

- **Product Dimension**: Contains detailed information about the products sold.
  - Primary key: **Product_ID**
  - **Product_Name**
  - **Product_Category** (e.g., Computers, Smartphones)
  - **Product_Subcategory** (e.g., Laptops, Desktops)
  - **Product_Brand**

- **Location Dimension**: Captures the geographic data of sales, enabling regional analysis.
  - Primary key: **Location_ID**
  - **City**
  - **State**
  - **Region**

- **Time Dimension**: Allows the temporal analysis of sales, with different granularities (day, month, year, etc.).
  - Primary key: **Time_ID**
  - **Date**
  - **Month**
  - **Year**
  - **Quarter**
  - **Seasonality** (e.g., End of Year, Black Friday)

### 3. **Relationships**
Fact tables relate to dimensions through **foreign keys**, forming a star schema (star model). These relationships are key to enabling data segmentation and analysis.

#### Example of Relationships:
- **Sales Fact** -> Relates to **Customer Dimension** through **Customer_ID**
- **Sales Fact** -> Relates to **Product Dimension** through **Product_ID**
- **Sales Fact** -> Relates to **Location Dimension** through **Location_ID**
- **Sales Fact** -> Relates to **Time Dimension** through **Time_ID**

### 4. **Key Possible Queries**
From this model, the company can perform detailed analyses and segmentations, such as:
- **Sales performance by region**: "What was the sales performance by region and state in the last quarter?"
- **Customer behavior analysis**: "Which types of customers (corporate or consumer) buy more products in the 'smartphones' category?"
- **Product performance analysis**: "Which products performed best during the end-of-year period?"

This conceptual model serves as a foundation to guide the development of an efficient data analysis system, enabling the company to extract strategic insights.
